Kara, I like how you made your program into a little game base on turtles and how each form is color match of your game. The comments
within the code is commented well with each reason of buttons and codes. I espically like the "Reset Table/Clear Filters" in the
MoreDetails form so the user can reset the table back to normal if they wanted to.

Once running the program, everything ran smoothly from the Form 1 welcome to choose a state to state Details [that I choose], and to 
MoreDetails [form] to see the rest of the states and different filters of "By Friends" and "By Treats".

Overall, your work continues to surprise me with your creativity. Additionally, your programming skills are next-level and I do not see
anything wrong with this program. Fantastic work! :)
